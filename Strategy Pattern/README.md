# Strategy Pattern

The strategy pattern encapsulates behaviors. By storing each behavior as a struct and maintaining a property to keep track of the behavior, we can change the output at runtime.


Most examples of the strategy pattern are written using classes, or abstract classes. I modified it to use strutcts because, well this is Swift.
